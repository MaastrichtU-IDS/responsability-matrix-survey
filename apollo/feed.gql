The data is anonymized by removing all sensitive fields as well as names of patients.  The data then goes through a data science lifecycle of selecting, cleaning and transforming the input for the analysis. Several Machine learning models (Logistic regression, LSTM and SVM) are tested to select the best performing models. The process is re-iterated to optimise performance. Phase 2: Through randomised clinical trials, patients are selected to be involved in this study in addition to the standard care. A cohort of 100 patients is selected. At random they are assigned"  },
