The Responsibility Matrix is developed as a general framework to explicitly design responsibility in data science projects. The Matrix stimulates thinking along dimensions that data scientists may be prone to overlook. The matrix helps you achieve the “responsible by design” as an integral part of your project by introducing eight dimensions composed of four components and four scopes. Within a two-dimensional space several questions arise whose answer will identify the responsibilities and outlook of the project.",
